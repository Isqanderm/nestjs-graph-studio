## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run specific test suites
npm run test              # Backend unit tests
npm run test:ui           # UI unit tests
npm run test:e2e          # E2E tests

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
npm run test:ui:watch

# Generate coverage reports
npm run test:coverage
npm run test:ui:coverage
```

### 4. Lint and Format

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Follow the [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines) below.

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub.

## Testing

### Test Coverage Requirements

We maintain high test coverage standards:

- **Backend:** Minimum 90% coverage
- **UI:** Minimum 70% coverage

### Writing Tests

#### Backend Tests (Vitest)

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('MyService', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    // Arrange
    const service = new MyService();
    
    // Act
    const result = service.doSomething();
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

#### UI Tests (Vitest + Testing Library)

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

#### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('should display graph view', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/graph-studio');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Graph View' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Enable strict mode
- Provide proper type annotations
- Avoid `any` types when possible

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add examples for new features

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.

### Commit Message Format

```

<body>

<footer>
